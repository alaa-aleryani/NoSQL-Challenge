# NoSQL Challenge
In this challenge, I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, `Eat Safe, Love`, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
As, the UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating.

**Part 1** and **Part 2** are done in `NoSQL_setup.ipynb`.
### Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
Used MongoDB.
### Part 2: Update the Database

We were asked to add, this new restaurant:
